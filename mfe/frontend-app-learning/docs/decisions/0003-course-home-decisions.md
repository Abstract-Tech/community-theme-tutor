# Course Home Decisions

The course home page is not complete as of this writing.

It was added to the MFE as a proof of concept for the Engagement theme's Always Available squad, as they were intending to do some work in the legacy course home page in the LMS, and we wanted to understand whether it would be more easily done in this application.

It uses the same APIs as the courseware page, for the most part.  This may not always be the case, but it is for now.  Differing API shapes may be faster for both pages.
