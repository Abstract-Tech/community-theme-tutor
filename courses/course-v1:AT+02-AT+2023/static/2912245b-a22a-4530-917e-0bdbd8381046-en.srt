00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:45,085
Hi, everybody. This is your cousin Brucie. Whoa!

1
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,189
Our summer romances are in full bloom, and everybody's in love!

2
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,358
So cousins, here's a great song from the Four Seasons.

3
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,469
That was the summer of 1963...

4
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:06,106
when everybody called me ""Baby"" and it didn't occur to me to mind.

5
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:17,150
That was before President Kennedy was shot...

6
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:19,185
before the Beatles came...

7
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:21,354
when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps...

8
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:25,325
and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad.

9
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:37,370
That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.

10
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:59,592
Ping-Pong in the west arcade, softball in the east diamond.

11
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:01,928
All you Sandy Koufaxes, get out there!

12
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:04,464
Complimentary dance lessons in the gazebo.

13
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,167
Oh, my God. Look at that!

14
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:11,371
Mom, I should've brought the coral shoes. You said I was taking too much.

15
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,074
Well, sweetheart, you brought ten pairs.

16
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:16,643
But the coral shoes matched that dress.

17
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,378
This is not a tragedy.

18
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:22,916
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in Birmingham.

19
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:25,185
Monks burning themselves in protest.

20
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:26,653
Butt out, Baby.

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,457
Okay, we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes!

22
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,493
We've got splish-splash the water class down by the lake.

23
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,197
We have the still life art class. We got volleyball and croquet.

24
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,799
And for you older folks, we got sacks!

25
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:42,569
Doc!

26
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:43,903
Doc!

27
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:45,839
Max!

28
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,677
Doc, after all these years I finally got you up on my mountain.

29
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:53,012
How's the blood pressure?

30
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,014
I want you girls to know...

31
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:58,485
if it were not for this man, I'd be standing here dead.

32
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,755
- Billy, get the bags. - Right away, Doc.

33
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:05,024
I kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls.

34
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,930
Hey, thanks a lot.

35
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:12,699
You want a job here?

36
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,935
There's a merengue class in the gazebo in the next few minutes.

37
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,705
The greatest teacher. Used to be a Rockette.

38
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:22,776
It's his first real vacation in six years, Max. Take it easy.

39
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:25,712
Three weeks here, it'll feel like a year.

40
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:29,349
One, two, three, four! Stomp those grapes and stomp some more!

41
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,586
One, two, three, four! Listen to the music!

42
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:35,055
Sorry.

43
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,890
Move your caboose and shake it loose!

44
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,794
One, two, three, four! Start the train!

45
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:48,068
Come on, men! Follow me into a round robin!

46
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,371
Ladies, the inner circle!

47
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:03,016
Come on, ladies!

48
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:07,520
God wouldn't have given you maracas if he didn't want you to shake them!

49
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,627
Okay now, ladies, when I say ""stop""...

50
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:17,697
you're gonna find the man of your dreams.

51
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:20,033
Stop!

52
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:25,839
Remember, he's the boss on the dance floor, if nowhere else.

53
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:37,951
Mom, Dad, I'm going up to the main house to look around.

54
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,291
There are two kinds of help here.

55
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,560
You waiters are all college guys...

56
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:24,531
and I went to Harvard and Yale to hire you.

57
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:27,567
And why did I do that? Why?

58
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,771
I shouldn't have to remind you. This is a family place.

59
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:35,642
That means you keep your fingers out of the water, hair out of the soup...

60
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,911
and show the goddamn daughters a good time.

61
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,146
All the daughters.

62
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,817
Even the dogs.

63
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,653
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace, show 'em the stars.

64
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:49,022
- Romance 'em any way you want. - Got that, guys?

65
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:51,091
Hey, hold it! Hold it.

66
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:56,629
Well, if it isn't the entertainment staff.

67
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,998
Listen, wise ass, you got your own rules.

68
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,267
Dance with the daughters. Teach 'em the mambo...

69
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,970
the cha-cha, anything they pay for.

70
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:05,638
That's it.

71
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,907
That's where it ends.

72
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:11,644
No funny business, no conversations, and keep you hands off!

73
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,218
It's the same at all these places. Some ass in the woods, but no conversation.

74
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,220
Watch it, Rodriguez.

75
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:26,359
Can you keep that straight, Johnny? What you can't lay your hands on?

76
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:34,567
Just put your pickle on everybody's plate, and leave the hard stuff to me.

77
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,810
Sit down and I'll get you some wine.

78
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,212
Thank you, Max.

79
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,251
This is Dr. and Mrs. Houseman.

80
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:55,388
Baby, Lisa, this is your waiter, Robbie Gould.

81
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,158
Yale medical school.

82
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:02,162
These people are my special guests. Give them anything they want.

83
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:04,164
- Enjoy. - Thanks, Max.

84
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:13,073
Look at all this leftover food. Are there still starving children in Europe?

85
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,875
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma. - Right.

86
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:18,545
Robbie, Baby wants to send her leftover pot roast...

87
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:21,748
to Southeast Asia, so anything you don't finish, wrap up.

88
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,285
Max, our Baby's gonna change the world.

89
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:28,722
- And what are you gonna do, Missy? - Lisa's gonna decorate it.

90
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,890
She already does.

91
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:36,830
Doc, I want you to meet someone. My grandson Neil.

92
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:39,299
Goes to the Cornell School of Hotel Management.

93
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,634
Baby's starting Mount Holyoke in the fall.

94
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:44,371
Oh, great.

95
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,614
Are you going to major in English?

96
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:58,151
No. Economics of underdeveloped countries.

97
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:01,621
- I'm going into the Peace Corps. - After the final show...

98
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:05,492
I'm going to Mississippi with a couple of busboys, freedom ride.

99
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,480
This is our own Tito Suarez.

100
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:17,163
Mambo! Yeah! Come on!

101
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:26,539
Who's that?

102
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:29,042
Oh, them. They're the dance people.

103
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:32,112
They're here to keep the guests happy.

104
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:58,905
They shouldn't show off with each other. That's not gonna sell lessons.

105
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:18,385
- Hi, kids. Having fun? - Yeah.

106
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:22,322
Actually, I've gotta excuse myself. I'm in charge of the games tonight.

107
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,125
Would you like to help me get things started?

108
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,860
Sure she would.

109
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,304
This'll only hurt for a minute. You've got Blue Cross, right?

110
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,183
Was that good for you?

111
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,853
And for being such a good sport, here you go!

112
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,328
I finally met a girl exactly like my mother.

113
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,498
Dresses like her, acts like her. So I brought her home.

114
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:07,500
My father doesn't like her!

115
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,071
Go figure.

116
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:02,689
- Hi. - How'd you get here?

117
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:04,357
- I was taking a walk. - Go back.

118
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:06,393
Let me help you. What's up there?

119
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:08,395
No guests allowed. House rules.

120
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:12,932
Why don't you go back to the playhouse? I saw you dancing with little boss man.

121
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:19,739
Can you keep a secret?

122
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:24,577
Your parents would kill you.

123
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,579
Max would kill me.

124
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,001
Where'd they learn to do that?

125
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:23,937
Where?

126
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:27,006
I don't know. Kids are doing it in their basements back home.

127
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:30,276
Wanna try it?

128
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:33,046
Come on, Baby.

129
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,153
Can you imagine dancing like this on the main floor...

130
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,655
home of the family fox-trot?

131
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,224
Max would close the place down first.

132
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:52,625
That's my cousin, Johnny Castle.

133
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,762
He got me the job here.

134
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:17,283
- They look great together. - Yeah.

135
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:19,786
You'd think they were a couple, wouldn't you?

136
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:23,623
- Aren't they? - No, not since we were kids.

137
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:03,363
Do you love me?

138
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:05,265
Do you love me?

139
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:27,854
Yo, cousin, what's she doing here?

140
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:31,191
She came with me. She's with me.

141
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:33,093
I carried a watermelon.

142
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:41,167
I carried a watermelon?

143
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:17,070
Bend your knees. Down.

144
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:23,309
Watch. Watch my eyes.

145
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,879
Good.

146
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:31,551
That's better.

147
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,391
Good. Now roll this way.

148
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,895
Now watch.

149
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:53,573
Look.

150
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:06,119
Love man!

151
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:45,258
Ladies, join our hair-raising wig show.

152
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:47,293
Try your Sandra Dee, Jackie Kennedy...

153
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:50,096
or Elizabeth Taylor-Cleopatra wig.

154
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,633
- I'll knock with three. - Look at that cute fella.

155
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,969
Look at these hands. They're golden hands.

156
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:01,641
My God, it's Cleopatra! I feel like such an ""asp"".

157
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,977
You look ten years younger.

158
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:06,980
At 10:.15, by the pool, we have calisthenics.

159
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:10,316
Then on the west porch, we have a symposium by Rabbi Maurice Sherman...

160
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,319
on the psychology of insult comedians.

161
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:18,058
So I say, ""Ask not what your waiter can do for you...

162
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:20,627
but what you can do for your waiter.""

163
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:23,663
If tips keep up, I'll have enough for my Alfa Romeo.

164
00:21:25,065 --> 00:21:26,900
That's my favorite car.

165
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,337
Ladies, you look very lovely.

166
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:36,309
Baby, would you cover for me tonight? Tell Mom and Dad I went to lie down.

167
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:38,144
Where are you going?

168
00:21:38,211 --> 00:21:42,182
To the golf course. There's a pretty view from the first tee.

169
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:47,721
Good. Thanks.

170
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:58,031
So you were really a Rockette?

171
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:00,166
I think you're a wonderful dancer.

172
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:03,670
Yeah? Well, my mother kicked me out when I was 16.

173
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:07,374
I've been dancing ever since. It's the only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.

174
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:10,677
I envy you.

175
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:38,571
- Aren't you dancing, Doc? - We're waiting for a waltz.

176
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:44,144
Hi, Max. Aren't my dance lessons starting to pay off?

177
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,714
You look great, Vivian! Terrific!

178
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,888
That's Vivian Pressman, one of the bungalow bunnies.

179
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:59,526
That's what we call the women who stay here all week.

180
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:03,263
The husbands only come up on weekends.

181
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:06,699
Moe Pressman's a big card player. He'll join our game.

182
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:11,104
- Moe coming up on Friday? - Friday.

183
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:14,441
He's away a lot. I know.

184
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,744
It's a hardship.

185
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:27,454
Where's Penny? Everybody's been asking for her.

186
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:32,892
What do you mean, where's Penny? She's taking a break.

187
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:35,462
As long as it's not an all-night break.

188
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,135
Come on, doll. Let's take a walk.

189
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:54,981
I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.

190
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:00,820
Maybe my parents are looking for me.

191
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,655
Baby, don't worry.

192
00:24:02,756 --> 00:24:06,493
If they think you're with me, they'll be the happiest parents at Kellerman's.

193
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:10,630
I have to say it.

194
00:24:10,697 --> 00:24:13,700
- I'm known as the catch of the county. - I'm sure you are.

195
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:16,870
Last week I took a girl away from Jamie, the lifeguard.

196
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:22,142
And he said to her, ""What does he have that I don't have?""

197
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,512
And she said, ""Two hotels.""

198
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:28,681
Robbie.

199
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,584
I don't hear an apology.

200
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:36,890
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and listen. Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.

201
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,861
I'm sorry you had to see that, Baby.

202
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:45,231
Sometimes in this world...

203
00:24:45,331 --> 00:24:47,867
you see things you don't wanna see.

204
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:54,374
You hungry?

205
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,876
Come on.

206
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:06,886
So, Baby, what do you want? You can have anything you want.

207
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,690
A brownie, some milk...

208
00:25:10,757 --> 00:25:14,260
Ieftover rice pudding, beets...

209
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,062
cabbage roll...

210
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,602
fruit salad, sweet gherkins?

211
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:26,740
Neil, look, I'm sorry. I better go check on Lisa.

212
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,575
Yeah.

213
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:01,307
- Why's she here? - In case Neil comes back.

214
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:03,443
Penny just doesn't think.

215
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,479
She wouldn't do anything stupid, would she?

216
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:11,051
So, what's wrong? What's the matter with her?

217
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:14,587
- She's knocked up, Baby. - Billy!

218
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:20,260
- What's he gonna do about it? - ""What's he gonna do about it?""

219
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:22,595
It's mine, right?

220
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:25,331
- Right away you think it's mine. - But I thought...

221
00:26:42,982 --> 00:26:45,652
It's okay. Johnny's here.

222
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:52,659
I'm never gonna let anything happen to you.

223
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,832
We got to go.

224
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,336
Just hold on. Just hold on.

225
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,972
Good girl. Good girl.

226
00:27:10,577 --> 00:27:13,580
What do you think you're doing? You're in trouble, you talk to me.

227
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,116
I'll take care of it.

228
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:19,686
You should've come to me in the first place.

229
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:23,156
Forget it, Johnny. I'm not taking what's left of your salary.

230
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:27,160
- Penny, that's my business. - Besides, it wouldn't be enough.

231
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:39,406
Oh, God, it's hopeless!

232
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:41,674
Don't say that.

233
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,711
There's gotta be a way to work it out.

234
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:50,683
Baby? Is that your name?

235
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:53,353
You know what, Baby?

236
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:56,856
You don't know shit about my problems.

237
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:00,026
I told her.

238
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:05,565
Jesus! She's gonna tell her management boyfriend and then we'll all get fired.

239
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:09,936
Why not skywrite it? ""Penny got knocked up by Robbie, the creep.""

240
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:12,639
- Look-- - No, Baby.

241
00:28:13,873 --> 00:28:16,710
One of the counselors knows a doctor, a real M.D....

242
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,779
just traveling through New Paltz one day next week.

243
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,649
We can get an appointment, but it costs $250.

244
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:26,352
But if it's Robbie, there's no problem. I know he has the money.

245
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,888
- I'm sure if you tell him-- - He knows.

246
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:40,500
Go back to your playpen, Baby.

247
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:50,477
- Why should you tell me what's right? - You can't just leave her.

248
00:28:50,477 --> 00:28:54,080
- Why should you tell me what's right? - You can't just leave her.

249
00:28:54,147 --> 00:28:57,650
I didn't blow a summer hauling bagels just to bail out some chick...

250
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,019
who probably slept with every guy here.

251
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:02,088
A little precision, please.

252
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:08,094
Some people count and some people don't.

253
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:10,930
Read it.

254
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:16,669
I think you'll enjoy it. But return it. I have notes in there.

255
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:22,208
You make me sick. Stay away from me.

256
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:26,579
Stay away from my sister or I'll have you fired.

257
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:42,862
What am I doing wrong?

258
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:45,865
You're lining it up a little wrong, Marge.

259
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:50,236
If your mother ever leaves me, it'll be for Arnold Palmer.

260
00:29:50,336 --> 00:29:53,139
- Daddy, someone's in trouble. - Besides your mother?

261
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:55,308
You're overcorrecting, Marge.

262
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:59,813
You always told me if someone was in trouble, I should help.

263
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:01,815
Could you lend me $250?

264
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:05,552
Are you all right? Are you in trouble?

265
00:30:05,618 --> 00:30:08,621
No, it's not me. Could you loan it to me?

266
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:11,257
That's a lot of money. What's it for?

267
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:13,460
Baby, stand up straight.

268
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:16,396
I can't tell you.

269
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:19,733
It's hard for me to say that to you, but I can't.

270
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:22,569
You always said you could tell me anything.

271
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:25,004
I can't tell you this.

272
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:29,509
It's not illegal, is it?

273
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:33,847
No, Daddy.

274
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:39,252
That was a stupid thing to ask. Forgive me.

275
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:42,856
I'll have it for you before dinner.

276
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:45,525
- Is everything all right? - Fine.

277
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:47,527
Thanks, Daddy.

278
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,589
Here's the money.

279
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,328
- You mean Robbie? - No. You were right about him?

280
00:31:55,428 --> 00:31:58,932
- Then where'd you get it? - You said you needed it.

281
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:03,536
- Is this kid for real? - Takes a real saint to ask Daddy.

282
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:11,211
Thanks, Baby, but I can't use it.

283
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:19,452
What? What's the matter with you? You should take the money.

284
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,922
I can only get her an appointment for Thursday.

285
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:25,291
They do their act at the Sheldrake Thursday.

286
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:29,195
If they cancel, they lose this season's salary and next year's gig.

287
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:30,830
What's the Sheldrake?

288
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,934
It's another hotel where they do their mambo act.

289
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,670
Can't someone else fill in?

290
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,641
No, ""Miss Fix-it."" Somebody else can't.

291
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:44,811
Maria has to work all day. She can't learn the routines.

292
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:47,981
And Janet has to fill in for Penny. Everybody works here.

293
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:51,651
You wanna do it? Take time out from ""Simon Says""?

294
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:56,056
It's not a bad idea.

295
00:32:57,057 --> 00:32:58,491
It was a 5oke.

296
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,029
- She can move. - It's the dumbest idea I ever heard of.

297
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:05,532
- I can't even do the merengue. - See?

298
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:08,168
You're a strong partner. You can lead anybody.

299
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:11,971
She can't even do the merengue. She cannot do it.

300
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,612
- No! - Oh, sorry. Sorry.

301
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:22,215
You don't step on the one.

302
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:26,052
You gotta start on the two. Find the two. Understand?

303
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:30,623
-I never did any of these dances before. -It's one, two, three, four.

304
00:33:30,724 --> 00:33:34,427
When the music starts, you don't dance until the two. Got it?

305
00:33:34,527 --> 00:33:36,529
Relax, relax.

306
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:38,364
Breathe.

307
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:40,700
Frame.

308
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:42,369
Nope.

309
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:50,377
Again.

310
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,412
Ow.

311
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:55,548
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

312
00:33:55,582 --> 00:33:58,251
Don't lean back. Lifting up.

313
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:00,720
Two, three, four. Shoulders down.

314
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:10,029
Again. Concentrate. And...

315
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,672
Don't put your heel down.

316
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:55,542
- Don't put your heel down. - I didn't--

317
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:58,078
Stay on the toe. Just listen to me.

318
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:00,447
The steps aren't enough.

319
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:02,549
Feel the music.

320
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:25,004
It's not on the one. It's not the mambo.

321
00:35:25,004 --> 00:35:27,640
It's not on the one. It's not the mambo.

322
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:30,744
It's a feeling, a heartbeat.

323
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:39,919
Don't try so hard.

324
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:46,292
Close your eyes.

325
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,502
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

326
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:00,140
Breathe.

327
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:15,755
Head up. Lock your frame. Lock it.

328
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:17,757
Look, spaghetti arm.

329
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,895
This is my dance space. This is your dance space.

330
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:25,432
I don't go into yours. You don't go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.

331
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:27,333
Again.

332
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,968
Frame.

333
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:23,543
Back. Easy.

334
00:39:23,543 --> 00:39:25,545
Back. Easy.

335
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:30,917
And turn, turn. Down. And lift. You'll learn that later.

336
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,886
And come on.

337
00:39:32,952 --> 00:39:34,921
Down. Twist.

338
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,589
And the bow.

339
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:39,626
- Sorry. Sorry. - You trying to kill me?

340
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:43,963
You gotta concentrate! Is that your idea of fun?

341
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:46,299
As a matter of fact it is.

342
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:50,270
We do the show in two days, you won't show me lifts, I'm not sure of turns.

343
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:53,940
I'm doing all this to save your ass, but I'd rather drop you on it!

344
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:57,277
Let's leave.

345
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:05,719
Shit!

346
00:40:07,954 --> 00:40:10,356
I locked the keys in the car!

347
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:35,215
You're getting wet, right?

348
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:49,829
- You're wild. - What?

349
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:52,065
You're wild!

350
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,565
Now, the most important thing to remember in lifts is balance.

351
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:28,334
Whoa! Whoa!

352
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:36,076
I got it now.

353
00:41:36,176 --> 00:41:39,079
So where'd you learn to be a dancer?

354
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,184
Well, this guy came into this luncheonette one day and...

355
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,454
we were all sitting around doing nothing.

356
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,091
And he said that Arthur Murray was giving a test for instructors.

357
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:53,460
So, if you passed...

358
00:41:57,697 --> 00:42:02,469
they teach you different dances, show you how to break them down, teach them.

359
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:07,474
What?

360
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:18,084
Good.

361
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:23,089
Don't look down. Look here. Good.

362
00:42:23,156 --> 00:42:24,858
And...

363
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,003
Now, bend your knees and go up. Go, go.

364
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:16,076
Good try. Now, you'll hurt me if you don't trust me, all right?

365
00:43:16,142 --> 00:43:18,078
Now, go, go. Go.

366
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:22,882
Good. Now, I'm gonna go up.

367
00:43:30,123 --> 00:43:33,393
You know, the best place to practice lifts is in the water.

368
00:43:33,493 --> 00:43:35,995
Just bend your knees. And... go.

369
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:38,465
Good.

370
00:43:38,531 --> 00:43:40,133
Good. Good.

371
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,302
Now hold the position. Hold it.

372
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,537
Good. Don't break! Don't break!

373
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,853
Let's do it again.

374
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:06,493
All right. One, two, three.

375
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:09,562
Oh, sorry.

376
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:13,066
Good. Keep-- No, don't.

377
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,582
It's not too bad.

378
00:44:32,952 --> 00:44:35,922
- One more time. - Okay. Over my head. Go.

379
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:37,724
I can't believe it's tonight.

380
00:44:37,724 --> 00:44:40,026
I can't believe it's tonight.

381
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:43,263
Sheldrake's 20 minutes away. We'll change in the car.

382
00:44:45,565 --> 00:44:49,035
Mrs. Schumacher. Hey, wait, we'll help you.

383
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,773
Such junk. Such junk.

384
00:44:55,341 --> 00:45:00,280
Benny Bernstein's Dancing School, that's where I went.

385
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,083
George Burns was a teacher.

386
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,886
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

387
00:45:11,624 --> 00:45:11,658
I'll just keep my shoulders down, my head up...

388
00:45:11,658 --> 00:45:14,427
I'll just keep my shoulders down, my head up...

389
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:17,630
my frame locked, stay on my toes...

390
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,766
What if I forget the steps?

391
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:23,370
Pull up, watch the frame. And remember, let him lead you.

392
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:27,774
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget to spike, get dizzy and fall on my face.

393
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:32,746
No. Don't look at my feet, keep my head up, my eyes open...

394
00:45:32,812 --> 00:45:36,783
tension in my arms, my frame locked, seat pulled up...

395
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,818
Thanks, Baby.

396
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,557
I just want you to know that I don't sleep around...

397
00:45:44,624 --> 00:45:47,660
whatever Robbie might have told you.

398
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,497
And I thought that he loved me.

399
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,666
I thought it was something special.

400
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:57,670
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that.

401
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:04,010
So, how does it look?

402
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:13,353
I'm scared.

403
00:46:15,822 --> 00:46:18,191
I'm so scared, Baby.

404
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:21,127
Don't worry.

405
00:46:21,728 --> 00:46:23,663
You'll be fine.

406
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:32,806
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! That's right. It's Thursday night at Kellerman's.

407
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:34,808
That's bingo night.

408
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:38,611
- Hey, how about a dance later? - Could be. Who knows?

409
00:46:38,678 --> 00:46:42,048
- Lisa, you have to do something for me. - I don't have to.

410
00:46:42,148 --> 00:46:46,486
Just tell Mom and Dad I have a headache and I'm in bed, okay?

411
00:46:49,022 --> 00:46:50,557
Bye.

412
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:52,325
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present Johnny Castle and partner...

413
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:56,696
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present Johnny Castle and partner...

414
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:59,065
in ""Mambo Magic.""

415
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:04,237
Relax.

416
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:39,139
Now spot a lead.

417
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:10,103
Wrong way!

418
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:20,280
Over here.

419
00:48:27,887 --> 00:48:29,656
Ready for the lift?

420
00:48:32,092 --> 00:48:33,426
Come on.

421
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,268
Keep going. Keep going.

422
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:28,882
...because wherever you are now, I want you to look at the sky.

423
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:33,219
Look at those stars. What a show. Here are The Drifters.

424
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:36,222
You did good. You worked hard.

425
00:49:36,256 --> 00:49:38,892
I saw that old couple from Kellerman's and I thought that was it.

426
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,960
Me too. Me too.

427
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,265
You know, by the second turn you really had it.

428
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:48,902
- But I didn't do the lift. - You did real good.

429
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,599
Thanks.

430
00:50:55,869 --> 00:50:57,437
Johnny!

431
00:50:57,504 --> 00:51:00,306
Come on. It's Penny.

432
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:04,511
- She wouldn't go until you returned. - Did you call an ambulance?

433
00:51:04,577 --> 00:51:07,280
She said the hospital would call the police. She made me promise.

434
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,183
He didn't use no ether, nothing.

435
00:51:10,283 --> 00:51:15,388
- I thought you said he was a real M.D.? - He had a dirty knife and a table.

436
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:17,757
I could hear her screaming in the hallway.

437
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:20,760
I swear to God, I tried to get in.

438
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:25,698
It's all right. Johnny's here.

439
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,414
What? What is it, Baby?

440
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:44,784
- Is it Lisa? - No.

441
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:03,803
Excuse me. Excuse me! Everybody clear out, please.

442
00:52:14,414 --> 00:52:17,617
Yes, I know that hurts. We're gonna take care of that.

443
00:52:21,187 --> 00:52:24,958
- Who's responsible for this girl? - I am.

444
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,394
Please, is she--

445
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:47,080
Doc, thanks a lot.

446
00:52:47,113 --> 00:52:50,417
I don't know how to thank you.

447
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,930
- Was that what my money paid for? - I'm sorry. I never meant to lie.

448
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:07,600
You're not the person I thought you were. I'm not sure who you are.

449
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:10,036
I don't want you to have anything to do with those people.

450
00:53:10,136 --> 00:53:14,174
Nothing! You're to have nothing to do with them ever again!

451
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:17,844
I won't tell your mother about this. Right now I'm going to bed.

452
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:21,281
And take that stuff off your face before your mother sees you!

453
00:53:25,518 --> 00:53:28,121
Is everything all right, Jake?

454
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:31,624
It's all right, Marjorie. Go back to sleep.

455
00:53:51,378 --> 00:53:53,313
Can I come in?

456
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:09,462
I got a-- I guess it's not a great room. You probably got a great room.

457
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:11,998
No. It's a great room!

458
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,411
Leave it on.

459
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,549
I'm sorry about the way my father treated you.

460
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,054
No. Your father was great.

461
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,824
He was great. The way he took care of Penny.

462
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,960
I mean the way he was with you.

463
00:54:41,061 --> 00:54:43,530
It's really me it has to do with.

464
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,868
Johnny, I came here because my father--

465
00:54:48,935 --> 00:54:52,605
No. The way he saved her-- I could never do anything like that.

466
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:56,676
That was something. People treat me like I'm nothing because I am nothing.

467
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,547
That's not true! You're everything!

468
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:05,518
You don't understand the way it is for somebody like me.

469
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:07,787
Last month I'm eating candy to stay alive.

470
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,857
This month, women are stuffing diamonds in my pockets.

471
00:55:10,924 --> 00:55:13,159
I'm balancing on shit and I can be down there again.

472
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,863
No, it's not the way it is! It doesn't have to be that way!

473
00:55:19,866 --> 00:55:22,869
I've never known anyone like you. You think you can make the world better.

474
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,004
Somebody's lost, you find them. Somebody's bleeding--

475
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:28,942
I go get my daddy. That's really brave, like you said.

476
00:55:29,008 --> 00:55:31,878
That took a lot of guts to go to him!

477
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,013
You are not scared of anything.

478
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,251
I'm scared of everything! I'm scared of what I saw.

479
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,955
I'm scared of what I did, who I am.

480
00:55:42,021 --> 00:55:47,360
I'm scared of walking out of here and never feeling for the rest of my life...

481
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,662
the way I feel when I'm with you!

482
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:13,319
Dance with me.

483
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,223
What, here?

484
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,958
Here.

485
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,275
Singers, dancers, actors, this is your lucky day!

486
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:25,745
Auditions for the annual Kellerman end-of-the-season talent show...

487
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:27,847
beginning in the playhouse.

488
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:37,524
- Everyone gonna be in the show? - We're leaving tomorrow.

489
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:39,726
Miss the weekend traffic.

490
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,694
But we're paid up 'til Sunday.

491
00:59:41,728 --> 00:59:44,731
- And miss the show? - I said we're leaving tomorrow.

492
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,834
- I was going to sing in the show. - It's the big event.

493
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:50,236
People bring their own arrangements. You don't want to miss it.

494
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,338
Baby, I need you for props.

495
00:59:53,873 --> 00:59:57,043
Why would you want to leave early?

496
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,853
It was just an idea. We can stay if you want to.

497
01:00:10,557 --> 01:00:14,160
- So, what were you planning to sing? - ""l Feel Pretty.""

498
01:00:14,227 --> 01:00:17,230
Or ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?""

499
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:21,067
Or ""l Feel Pretty."" What do you think, Daddy?

500
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,514
You look much better.

501
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:40,754
You just missed your father. He's such a wonderful man.

502
01:00:42,622 --> 01:00:45,191
I'm sorry. I didn't realize--

503
01:00:45,258 --> 01:00:47,594
You couldn't have. It's okay.

504
01:00:59,606 --> 01:01:02,409
- So, how you doin'? - I'm okay.

505
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:06,446
Dr. Houseman says I'm going to be fine.

506
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:11,584
- I can still have children. - Oh, Penny, that's really great.

507
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:16,923
So, how did it go last night?

508
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,958
Good.

509
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,764
Fine. I didn't do the lifts, but it was good.

510
01:01:35,475 --> 01:01:40,180
Well, I guess I gonna go.

511
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:43,983
See ya.

512
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:54,360
- So, he says you're going to be fine? - What are you doing?

513
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:57,897
- I'll tell Max your grandmother died. - How many times have you told me...

514
01:01:57,997 --> 01:02:00,734
never get mixed-up with them?

515
01:02:00,834 --> 01:02:02,736
I know what I'm doing.

516
01:02:03,837 --> 01:02:07,607
You listen to me. You've got to stop it now.

517
01:02:23,556 --> 01:02:26,760
Look, I gotta run. I got a lesson with the Kramers.

518
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,229
They'll kill each other if I'm not there.

519
01:02:29,295 --> 01:02:31,731
Well, sure. You've gotta go.

520
01:02:34,534 --> 01:02:35,935
I'll see ya.

521
01:02:55,488 --> 01:02:58,391
It's rainy day game time. Pin the tail on the guest.

522
01:02:58,491 --> 01:03:00,894
Win ten boxes of Kleenex or a billy goat!

523
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:05,432
God, I am so sick of this rain.

524
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,234
Remind me not to take my honeymoon at Niagara Falls.

525
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:11,438
So, you go to Acapulco. It'll be fine.

526
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:15,141
Where is my beige iridescent lipstick?

527
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:17,410
I know I put it in this drawer.

528
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,713
Baby, where are you going in this weather?

529
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:22,382
Uh, they're having charades in the west lobby.

530
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:25,385
Quite the little joiner, aren't we?

531
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:43,536
- Have you had many women? - What?

532
01:03:46,306 --> 01:03:48,141
Baby, come on.

533
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:50,143
Tell me. I want to know.

534
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:04,124
You gotta understand what it's like.

535
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,626
You come from the streets and suddenly you're up here.

536
01:04:06,726 --> 01:04:10,597
Women are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good.

537
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:12,766
They really take care of themselves.

538
01:04:12,832 --> 01:04:15,268
I never knew women could be like that.

539
01:04:15,335 --> 01:04:18,605
They're so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything.

540
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:21,374
They're slippin' their room keys in my hand two and three times a day--

541
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:25,645
different women-- so, I think I'm scorin' big, right?

542
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:30,150
You think, ""They wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care about me, right?""

543
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:34,320
That's all right. I understand. You were just using them, that's all.

544
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,757
No, that's not it.

545
01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:40,960
That's the thing. It wasn't like that.

546
01:04:43,063 --> 01:04:45,165
They were using me.

547
01:05:12,726 --> 01:05:14,661
What's your real name, Baby?

548
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:20,834
Frances, for the first woman in the Cabinet.

549
01:05:23,036 --> 01:05:26,406
Frances. That's a real grownup name.

550
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:42,021
I've decided to go all the way with Robbie.

551
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:48,294
No, not with someone like him.

552
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:52,732
Do you think if we came back for a ten-year anniversary, it would be free?

553
01:05:52,832 --> 01:05:56,302
It's just wrong this way. It should be with someone--

554
01:05:56,403 --> 01:06:01,007
With someone that you sort of love.

555
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:05,278
Come on. You don't care about me.

556
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,381
You wouldn't care if I humped the entire army...

557
01:06:08,448 --> 01:06:11,618
as long as we were on the right side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

558
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:16,556
What you care about is that you're not Daddy's girl anymore.

559
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:19,059
He listens when I talk now.

560
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:21,594
You hate that.

561
01:06:38,778 --> 01:06:41,514
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

562
01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:44,484
My frame. Where's my pleasing arc?

563
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:48,121
Spaghetti arms! Would you give me some tension, please?

564
01:06:49,989 --> 01:06:53,359
You're invading my dance space. This is my dance space.

565
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,829
That's yours. Let's cha-cha.

566
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:04,671
Don't look down. Look right here.

567
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:18,351
- How you call your lover boy? - Come here, lover boy.

568
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,988
- And if he doesn't answer? - Oh, lover boy.

569
01:07:22,088 --> 01:07:25,458
- And if still doesn't answer? - I simply say...

570
01:07:25,492 --> 01:07:28,261
Baby

571
01:07:28,328 --> 01:07:31,164
O-Oh, baby

572
01:07:32,265 --> 01:07:35,101
My sweet baby

573
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,104
You're the one

574
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,988
Takin' dance lessons?

575
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:57,991
I could teach ya, kid.

576
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:05,665
My grandfather put me in charge of the final show.

577
01:08:05,732 --> 01:08:08,034
I want to talk to you about the last dance.

578
01:08:08,134 --> 01:08:11,204
I'd like to shake things up a bit.

579
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,907
You know, move with the times.

580
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,009
I've got a lot of ideas.

581
01:08:16,076 --> 01:08:18,178
I've been working with the staff kids...

582
01:08:18,211 --> 01:08:21,748
on a cross between a Cuban rhythm and soul dancing.

583
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:24,617
Whoa, boy.

584
01:08:24,718 --> 01:08:26,953
Way over your head here.

585
01:08:27,053 --> 01:08:31,024
You always do the mambo, huh?

586
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:34,327
Why not dance this year's final dance...

587
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,231
to the pachenga?

588
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:40,533
Right.

589
01:08:42,736 --> 01:08:46,439
Well, you're free to do the same, tired number as last year if you want...

590
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:49,442
but next year we'll find another dance person...

591
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,911
- who'll only be too happy-- - Sure, Neil. No problem.

592
01:08:54,114 --> 01:08:56,282
We'll end the season with the pachenga.

593
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:57,817
Great idea.

594
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:08,762
Sometimes he's hard to talk to, but the ladies seem to like him.

595
01:09:08,795 --> 01:09:11,798
See that he gives you the full half-hour you're paying him for, kid.

596
01:09:20,673 --> 01:09:23,743
That little wimp. He wouldn't know a new idea if it hit him in the pachenga.

597
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:26,112
I could have told him some new ideas.

598
01:09:26,212 --> 01:09:28,214
Why did you let him talk to you that way?

599
01:09:28,281 --> 01:09:30,750
- What, fight the boss man? - You tell him your ideas.

600
01:09:30,817 --> 01:09:33,620
- He's a person like everyone else. - Look, I know these people.

601
01:09:33,686 --> 01:09:36,389
They are rich and they're mean. They won't listen to me.

602
01:09:36,456 --> 01:09:38,858
Why not fight harder? Make them listen.

603
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:41,828
Because I need this goddamned job lined up for next summer.

604
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,998
My dad calls me today.

605
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,701
""Good news,"" he says. ""Uncle Paul can finally get you in the union.""

606
01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:49,035
What union?

607
01:09:50,236 --> 01:09:54,140
The House Painters and Plasterers Local Number 179 at your service.

608
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:04,818
I've been thinking a lot about the Domino Theory.

609
01:10:04,884 --> 01:10:07,253
Now, when Viet Nam falls, is China Next?

610
01:10:10,056 --> 01:10:11,991
I don't think they saw us.

611
01:10:23,169 --> 01:10:24,637
Fight harder, huh?

612
01:10:25,672 --> 01:10:29,442
I don't see you fightin' so hard, tellin' Daddy I'm your guy.

613
01:10:29,509 --> 01:10:31,678
I will. With my father, it's complicated.

614
01:10:31,745 --> 01:10:34,180
- I will tell him. - I don't believe you, Baby.

615
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:39,319
I don't think...

616
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:43,623
that you ever had any intention of telling him.

617
01:10:44,691 --> 01:10:45,825
Ever.

618
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,870
Well, Cousin, it's almost over. Labor Day weekend is here.

619
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:59,706
Well, Cousin, it's almost over. Labor Day weekend is here.

620
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:03,476
Soon it's back to the old books and back to work. What a terrible thought!

621
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:15,188
Have you seen Johnny?

622
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:32,272
I'm sorry.

623
01:11:36,743 --> 01:11:38,678
Looks like I picked the wrong sister.

624
01:11:38,745 --> 01:11:41,548
That's okay, Baby. I went slummin' too.

625
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,067
Hit me.

626
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:10,110
Get out of here. You're not worth it.

627
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,503
Win big, Moe.

628
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:11,838
As always.

629
01:13:29,389 --> 01:13:33,226
This is our last night together, lover. I've got something worked out for us.

630
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:58,184
Excuse me, sir. The pirate number's next.

631
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:00,553
Oh, thanks. Hey, kid.

632
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:03,356
I've been playing cards all weekend and I've got an all-night game tonight.

633
01:14:03,423 --> 01:14:06,926
Why don't you give my wife some extra dance lessons?

634
01:14:16,002 --> 01:14:17,904
I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman...

635
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:20,473
but I'm booked up for the whole weekend with the show.

636
01:14:20,573 --> 01:14:22,776
I won't have time for anything else.

637
01:14:22,842 --> 01:14:26,046
I don't think it'd be fair to take the money.

638
01:14:50,804 --> 01:14:53,640
I've decided tonight's the night with Robbie.

639
01:14:53,673 --> 01:14:55,875
He doesn't even know yet.

640
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:32,846
It's me.

641
01:15:38,017 --> 01:15:39,352
Holy shit!

642
01:16:00,407 --> 01:16:02,509
You wanna hear somethin' crazy?

643
01:16:06,846 --> 01:16:08,314
Last night l--

644
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:13,753
I dreamt we were walking along and we met your father.

645
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,489
He said, ""Come on,"" and he put his arm around me.

646
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:20,293
Just like he did with Robbie.

647
01:17:07,574 --> 01:17:12,812
You know how you feel when you see a patient and you think he's all right...

648
01:17:12,912 --> 01:17:15,882
then you look at the X rays and it's nothing like you thought?

649
01:17:15,915 --> 01:17:17,183
What happened?

650
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,720
It's exactly what it's like when you find out one of your staff's a thief.

651
01:17:20,754 --> 01:17:24,424
Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night.

652
01:17:24,524 --> 01:17:27,527
It was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair.

653
01:17:27,594 --> 01:17:31,831
He had it at 1:30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4::00...

654
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:34,300
it was missing.

655
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:38,905
Vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid Johnny...

656
01:17:38,972 --> 01:17:40,240
walking by.

657
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:45,211
So we ask him, ""You have an alibi for last night?""

658
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:47,480
He says he was alone in his room reading.

659
01:17:48,848 --> 01:17:51,284
There are no books in Johnny's room!

660
01:17:53,253 --> 01:17:55,321
There's been a mistake. I know Johnny didn't do it.

661
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:57,857
There's been similar thefts at the Sheldrake. It's happened here before.

662
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:00,293
- Three other wallets. - I know he didn't do it.

663
01:18:00,393 --> 01:18:02,462
Stay out of it, Baby.

664
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:06,399
Wait. Don't put those tables together. Come on.

665
01:18:08,635 --> 01:18:12,706
Daddy, I need your help. I know Johnny didn't take Moe's wallet.

666
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:15,141
- Oh? How do you know? - I can't tell you.

667
01:18:15,241 --> 01:18:20,013
- Just please trust me, Daddy. - I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.

668
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:22,182
This Danish is pure protein.

669
01:18:25,018 --> 01:18:28,722
Maybe Johnny didn't do it. Anyone could've taken it.

670
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,724
Maybe it was, uh--

671
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:33,660
It could've been that little, old couple, the Schumachers.

672
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,963
- I saw her with a couple of wallets. - Sylvia and Sidney?

673
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:40,066
Baby, you don't go around accusing innocent people.

674
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:44,637
I even saw them at the Sheldrake. You said something was stolen from there.

675
01:18:44,704 --> 01:18:48,308
I got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi.

676
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:52,312
Come on, Neil. You'll learn what it's like to fire an employee.

677
01:18:53,513 --> 01:18:57,016
Wait a minute. I know Johnny didn't take the wallet.

678
01:18:57,083 --> 01:19:00,320
I know because he was in his room all night.

679
01:19:00,387 --> 01:19:04,891
And the reason I know is because I was with him.

680
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:31,217
I told you I was telling the truth.

681
01:19:36,089 --> 01:19:38,058
I'm sorry I lied to you.

682
01:19:40,927 --> 01:19:42,896
But you lied too.

683
01:19:45,098 --> 01:19:48,668
You told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break.

684
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,837
But you meant everyone who is like you.

685
01:19:53,573 --> 01:19:56,843
You told me you wanted me to change the world, to make it better.

686
01:19:57,911 --> 01:20:00,547
But you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist...

687
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,749
and marrying someone from Harvard.

688
01:20:05,418 --> 01:20:07,954
I'm not proud of myself.

689
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:11,558
But I'm in this family too. You can't keep giving me the silent treatment.

690
01:20:15,095 --> 01:20:17,931
There are a lot of things about me that aren't what you thought.

691
01:20:18,965 --> 01:20:21,935
But if you love me, you have to love all the things about me.

692
01:20:24,604 --> 01:20:26,539
And I love you.

693
01:20:26,606 --> 01:20:31,177
I'm sorry I let you down. I'm so sorry, Daddy.

694
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:34,314
But you let me down too.

695
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:06,813
I have been lookin' for you all over.

696
01:21:07,814 --> 01:21:09,649
They found the Schumachers.

697
01:21:09,749 --> 01:21:12,052
Fingerprinted their water glasses.

698
01:21:12,152 --> 01:21:14,988
Found out they were wanted in Arizona and in Florida...

699
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:17,490
and they made a fortune here this summer.

700
01:21:17,524 --> 01:21:19,492
So then it's all right.

701
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:22,629
I knew it would work out.

702
01:21:22,695 --> 01:21:24,998
- I knew they'd have to apologize. - I'm out, Baby.

703
01:21:30,236 --> 01:21:32,172
They fired you anyway because of me.

704
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,177
And if I leave quietly, I'll get my summer bonus.

705
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,082
So I did it for nothing.

706
01:21:42,182 --> 01:21:46,186
I hurt my family, you lost your job anyway-- I did it for nothing!

707
01:21:46,252 --> 01:21:48,188
No, not for nothing.

708
01:21:48,254 --> 01:21:51,624
Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before.

709
01:21:52,392 --> 01:21:55,628
You were right. You can't win no matter what you do.

710
01:21:55,695 --> 01:21:59,165
Listen to me. I don't want to hear that from you. You can.

711
01:22:01,067 --> 01:22:03,169
I used to think so.

712
01:22:24,758 --> 01:22:26,860
Dr. Houseman, can l, uh--

713
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:31,398
Look, I'm going anyway and I know what you must be thinking.

714
01:22:31,464 --> 01:22:34,434
You don't know anything at all about me.

715
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:37,237
I know you want Baby to be like you.

716
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,106
The kind of person people look up to.

717
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:42,409
Baby is like that. If you could just see--

718
01:22:42,442 --> 01:22:45,412
Don't you tell me what to see.

719
01:22:45,445 --> 01:22:48,081
I see someone in front of me who got his partner in trouble...

720
01:22:48,114 --> 01:22:50,550
and sent her off to some butcher...

721
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:53,887
while he moved on to an innocent, young girl like my daughter.

722
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:01,661
Yeah, I guess that's what you would see.

723
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:20,480
I can't imagine being here without you even one day.

724
01:23:20,513 --> 01:23:24,284
Just think, you have more time for horseshoes and croquet.

725
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,956
Maybe they'll saw you in seven pieces now.

726
01:23:32,358 --> 01:23:34,461
I guess we surprised everybody.

727
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,765
I guess we did.

728
01:23:46,773 --> 01:23:48,675
Hardly would be sorry.

729
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:52,178
Neither will l.

730
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:00,987
I'll see ya.

731
01:24:57,177 --> 01:24:59,145
I'll do your hair.

732
01:25:01,247 --> 01:25:03,349
It could look pretty if--

733
01:25:09,255 --> 01:25:11,691
You're prettier your way.

734
01:25:11,758 --> 01:25:13,026
This way.

735
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:39,986
Kellermans, we come together

736
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:44,090
Singing all as one

737
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:48,294
We have shared another season's

738
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:52,298
Talent, play and fun

739
01:25:52,365 --> 01:25:56,469
Summer days will soon be over

740
01:25:56,569 --> 01:26:00,673
Soon the autumn starts

741
01:26:00,774 --> 01:26:04,677
And tonight the memories whisper

742
01:26:04,778 --> 01:26:08,148
Softly in our hearts

743
01:26:09,215 --> 01:26:13,086
Join hands and hearts and voices

744
01:26:13,153 --> 01:26:16,556
Voices, hearts and hands

745
01:26:16,623 --> 01:26:20,560
At Kellerman's the friendships last

746
01:26:20,627 --> 01:26:25,165
Long as the mountain stands

747
01:26:25,231 --> 01:26:29,502
Daytime, nighttime, any hour

748
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:33,440
Weather rain or shine

749
01:26:33,506 --> 01:26:37,711
Games and lectures Jokes and music

750
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:41,848
Happily combine

751
01:26:55,261 --> 01:26:57,163
Good luck in medical school, son.

752
01:26:59,365 --> 01:27:01,901
And I wanted to thank you for your help with the Penny situation.

753
01:27:01,968 --> 01:27:05,805
- I guess we've all gotten into messes. - What?

754
01:27:07,507 --> 01:27:10,310
I thought Baby told you. Look, I'm not sure.

755
01:27:10,377 --> 01:27:13,613
Penny said so, but you know with girls like that. They're liable to pin it...

756
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:15,615
on any guy around.

757
01:27:21,855 --> 01:27:24,457
- What's the hot tip for the day? - Finished.

758
01:27:25,525 --> 01:27:28,395
You and me, Tito. We've seen it all, eh?

759
01:27:28,495 --> 01:27:33,566
Bubbah and Zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders.

760
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,835
Through the war years when we didn't have any meat.

761
01:27:35,902 --> 01:27:38,638
Through the Depression when we didn't have anything.

762
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:41,174
Lots of changes, though, Max.

763
01:27:41,207 --> 01:27:44,711
It's not the changes so much this time.

764
01:27:44,778 --> 01:27:47,347
It's that it all seems to be ending.

765
01:27:47,414 --> 01:27:51,418
You think kids want to come with their parents and take fox-trot lessons?

766
01:27:51,518 --> 01:27:54,654
Trips to Europe, that's what the kids want.

767
01:27:55,722 --> 01:27:58,291
Twenty-two countries in three days.

768
01:27:59,392 --> 01:28:01,661
It feels like it's all slipping away.

769
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:06,733
But the heartbeats of vacation

770
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:10,704
There no cares are seen

771
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:14,741
So let's join in just one last chorus

772
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:18,211
Visitors, staff and guests

773
01:28:18,244 --> 01:28:22,782
What we've shared won't be forgotten

774
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:25,919
Old friends are the best

775
01:29:01,454 --> 01:29:03,189
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.

776
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:06,359
Come on.

777
01:29:27,113 --> 01:29:29,315
Sorry about the disruption, folks...

778
01:29:29,382 --> 01:29:32,652
but I always do the last dance of the season.

779
01:29:32,752 --> 01:29:35,755
This year somebody told me not to.

780
01:29:35,789 --> 01:29:39,626
So I'm gonna do my kind of dancin' with a great partner...

781
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:43,363
who's not only a terrific dancer...

782
01:29:43,463 --> 01:29:45,932
but somebody who's taught me that there are people...

783
01:29:45,965 --> 01:29:49,002
willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them.

784
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,939
Somebody who's taught me...

785
01:29:54,874 --> 01:29:56,976
about the kind of person I want to be.

786
01:29:58,178 --> 01:29:59,646
Miss Frances Houseman.

787
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,881
Sit down, Jake.

788
01:31:25,732 --> 01:31:27,801
I think she gets this from me.

789
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:25,211
Do you have sheet music on this stuff?

790
01:34:33,286 --> 01:34:36,389
I know you weren't the one who got Penny in trouble.

791
01:34:38,558 --> 01:34:41,027
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.

792
01:34:47,567 --> 01:34:49,502
You looked wonderful out there.

793
01:35:47,193 --> 01:35:49,295
Now l

794
01:35:49,362 --> 01:35:53,333
Had the time of my life

795
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,570
No, I never felt this way before

796
01:35:57,637 --> 01:36:00,040
Yes, I swear

797
01:36:00,106 --> 01:36:04,644
It's so true And I owe it all to you
