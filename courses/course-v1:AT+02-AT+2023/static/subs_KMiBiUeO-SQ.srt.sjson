    "Hi, everybody. This is your cousin Brucie. Whoa!",
    "Our summer romances are in full bloom, and everybody's in love!",
    "So cousins, here's a great song from the Four Seasons.",
    "That was the summer of 1963...",
    "when everybody called me \"\"Baby\"\" and it didn't occur to me to mind.",
    "That was before President Kennedy was shot...",
    "before the Beatles came...",
    "when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps...",
    "and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad.",
    "That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.",
    "Ping-Pong in the west arcade, softball in the east diamond.",
    "All you Sandy Koufaxes, get out there!",
    "Complimentary dance lessons in the gazebo.",
    "Oh, my God. Look at that!",
    "Mom, I should've brought the coral shoes. You said I was taking too much.",
    "Well, sweetheart, you brought ten pairs.",
    "But the coral shoes matched that dress.",
    "This is not a tragedy.",
    "A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in Birmingham.",
    "Monks burning themselves in protest.",
    "Butt out, Baby.",
    "Okay, we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes!",
    "We've got splish-splash the water class down by the lake.",
    "We have the still life art class. We got volleyball and croquet.",
    "And for you older folks, we got sacks!",
    "Doc!",
    "Doc!",
    "Max!",
    "Doc, after all these years I finally got you up on my mountain.",
    "How's the blood pressure?",
    "I want you girls to know...",
    "if it were not for this man, I'd be standing here dead.",
    "- Billy, get the bags. - Right away, Doc.",
    "I kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls.",
    "Hey, thanks a lot.",
    "You want a job here?",
    "There's a merengue class in the gazebo in the next few minutes.",
    "The greatest teacher. Used to be a Rockette.",
    "It's his first real vacation in six years, Max. Take it easy.",
    "Three weeks here, it'll feel like a year.",
    "One, two, three, four! Stomp those grapes and stomp some more!",
    "One, two, three, four! Listen to the music!",
    "Sorry.",
    "Move your caboose and shake it loose!",
    "One, two, three, four! Start the train!",
    "Come on, men! Follow me into a round robin!",
    "Ladies, the inner circle!",
    "Come on, ladies!",
    "God wouldn't have given you maracas if he didn't want you to shake them!",
    "Okay now, ladies, when I say \"\"stop\"\"...",
    "you're gonna find the man of your dreams.",
    "Stop!",
    "Remember, he's the boss on the dance floor, if nowhere else.",
    "Mom, Dad, I'm going up to the main house to look around.",
    "There are two kinds of help here.",
    "You waiters are all college guys...",
    "and I went to Harvard and Yale to hire you.",
    "And why did I do that? Why?",
    "I shouldn't have to remind you. This is a family place.",
    "That means you keep your fingers out of the water, hair out of the soup...",
    "and show the goddamn daughters a good time.",
    "All the daughters.",
    "Even the dogs.",
    "Schlepp 'em out to the terrace, show 'em the stars.",
    "- Romance 'em any way you want. - Got that, guys?",
    "Hey, hold it! Hold it.",
    "Well, if it isn't the entertainment staff.",
    "Listen, wise ass, you got your own rules.",
    "Dance with the daughters. Teach 'em the mambo...",
    "the cha-cha, anything they pay for.",
    "That's it.",
    "That's where it ends.",
    "No funny business, no conversations, and keep you hands off!",
    "It's the same at all these places. Some ass in the woods, but no conversation.",
    "Watch it, Rodriguez.",
    "Can you keep that straight, Johnny? What you can't lay your hands on?",
    "Just put your pickle on everybody's plate, and leave the hard stuff to me.",
    "Sit down and I'll get you some wine.",
    "Thank you, Max.",
    "This is Dr. and Mrs. Houseman.",
    "Baby, Lisa, this is your waiter, Robbie Gould.",
    "Yale medical school.",
    "These people are my special guests. Give them anything they want.",
    "- Enjoy. - Thanks, Max.",
    "Look at all this leftover food. Are there still starving children in Europe?",
    "- Try Southeast Asia, Ma. - Right.",
    "Robbie, Baby wants to send her leftover pot roast...",
    "to Southeast Asia, so anything you don't finish, wrap up.",
    "Max, our Baby's gonna change the world.",
    "- And what are you gonna do, Missy? - Lisa's gonna decorate it.",
    "She already does.",
    "Doc, I want you to meet someone. My grandson Neil.",
    "Goes to the Cornell School of Hotel Management.",
    "Baby's starting Mount Holyoke in the fall.",
    "Oh, great.",
    "Are you going to major in English?",
    "No. Economics of underdeveloped countries.",
    "- I'm going into the Peace Corps. - After the final show...",
    "I'm going to Mississippi with a couple of busboys, freedom ride.",
    "This is our own Tito Suarez.",
    "Mambo! Yeah! Come on!",
    "Who's that?",
    "Oh, them. They're the dance people.",
    "They're here to keep the guests happy.",
    "They shouldn't show off with each other. That's not gonna sell lessons.",
    "- Hi, kids. Having fun? - Yeah.",
    "Actually, I've gotta excuse myself. I'm in charge of the games tonight.",
    "Would you like to help me get things started?",
    "Sure she would.",
    "This'll only hurt for a minute. You've got Blue Cross, right?",
    "Was that good for you?",
    "And for being such a good sport, here you go!",
    "I finally met a girl exactly like my mother.",
    "Dresses like her, acts like her. So I brought her home.",
    "My father doesn't like her!",
    "Go figure.",
    "- Hi. - How'd you get here?",
    "- I was taking a walk. - Go back.",
    "Let me help you. What's up there?",
    "No guests allowed. House rules.",
    "Why don't you go back to the playhouse? I saw you dancing with little boss man.",
    "Can you keep a secret?",
    "Your parents would kill you.",
    "Max would kill me.",
    "Where'd they learn to do that?",
    "Where?",
    "I don't know. Kids are doing it in their basements back home.",
    "Wanna try it?",
    "Come on, Baby.",
    "Can you imagine dancing like this on the main floor...",
    "home of the family fox-trot?",
    "Max would close the place down first.",
    "That's my cousin, Johnny Castle.",
    "He got me the job here.",
    "- They look great together. - Yeah.",
    "You'd think they were a couple, wouldn't you?",
    "- Aren't they? - No, not since we were kids.",
    "Do you love me?",
    "Do you love me?",
    "Yo, cousin, what's she doing here?",
    "She came with me. She's with me.",
    "I carried a watermelon.",
    "I carried a watermelon?",
    "Bend your knees. Down.",
    "Watch. Watch my eyes.",

    "I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman...",
    "but I'm booked up for the whole weekend with the show.",
    "I won't have time for anything else.",
    "I don't think it'd be fair to take the money.",
    "I've decided tonight's the night with Robbie.",
    "He doesn't even know yet.",
    "It's me.",
    "Holy shit!",
    "You wanna hear somethin' crazy?",
    "Last night l--",
    "I dreamt we were walking along and we met your father.",
    "He said, \"\"Come on,\"\" and he put his arm around me.",
    "Just like he did with Robbie.",
    "You know how you feel when you see a patient and you think he's all right...",
    "then you look at the X rays and it's nothing like you thought?",
    "What happened?",
    "It's exactly what it's like when you find out one of your staff's a thief.",
    "Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night.",
    "It was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair.",
    "He had it at 1:30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4::00...",
    "it was missing.",
    "Vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid Johnny...",
    "walking by.",
    "So we ask him, \"\"You have an alibi for last night?\"\"",
    "He says he was alone in his room reading.",
    "There are no books in Johnny's room!",
    "There's been a mistake. I know Johnny didn't do it.",
    "There's been similar thefts at the Sheldrake. It's happened here before.",
    "- Three other wallets. - I know he didn't do it.",
    "Stay out of it, Baby.",
    "Wait. Don't put those tables together. Come on.",
    "Daddy, I need your help. I know Johnny didn't take Moe's wallet.",
    "- Oh? How do you know? - I can't tell you.",
    "- Just please trust me, Daddy. - I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.",
    "This Danish is pure protein.",
    "Maybe Johnny didn't do it. Anyone could've taken it.",
    "Maybe it was, uh--",
    "It could've been that little, old couple, the Schumachers.",
    "- I saw her with a couple of wallets. - Sylvia and Sidney?",
    "Baby, you don't go around accusing innocent people.",
    "I even saw them at the Sheldrake. You said something was stolen from there.",
    "I got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi.",
    "Come on, Neil. You'll learn what it's like to fire an employee.",
    "Wait a minute. I know Johnny didn't take the wallet.",
    "I know because he was in his room all night.",
    "And the reason I know is because I was with him.",
    "I told you I was telling the truth.",
    "I'm sorry I lied to you.",
    "But you lied too.",
    "You told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break.",
    "But you meant everyone who is like you.",
    "You told me you wanted me to change the world, to make it better.",
    "But you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist...",
    "and marrying someone from Harvard.",
    "I'm not proud of myself.",
    "But I'm in this family too. You can't keep giving me the silent treatment.",
    "There are a lot of things about me that aren't what you thought.",
    "But if you love me, you have to love all the things about me.",
    "And I love you.",
    "I'm sorry I let you down. I'm so sorry, Daddy.",
    "But you let me down too.",
    "I have been lookin' for you all over.",
    "They found the Schumachers.",
    "Fingerprinted their water glasses.",
    "Found out they were wanted in Arizona and in Florida...",
    "and they made a fortune here this summer.",
    "So then it's all right.",
    "I knew it would work out.",
    "- I knew they'd have to apologize. - I'm out, Baby.",
    "They fired you anyway because of me.",
    "And if I leave quietly, I'll get my summer bonus.",
    "So I did it for nothing.",
    "I hurt my family, you lost your job anyway-- I did it for nothing!",
    "No, not for nothing.",
    "Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before.",
    "You were right. You can't win no matter what you do.",
    "Listen to me. I don't want to hear that from you. You can.",
    "I used to think so.",
    "Dr. Houseman, can l, uh--",
    "Look, I'm going anyway and I know what you must be thinking.",
    "You don't know anything at all about me.",
    "I know you want Baby to be like you.",
    "The kind of person people look up to.",
    "Baby is like that. If you could just see--",
    "Don't you tell me what to see.",
    "I see someone in front of me who got his partner in trouble...",
    "and sent her off to some butcher...",
    "while he moved on to an innocent, young girl like my daughter.",
    "Yeah, I guess that's what you would see.",
    "I can't imagine being here without you even one day.",
    "Just think, you have more time for horseshoes and croquet.",
    "Maybe they'll saw you in seven pieces now.",
    "I guess we surprised everybody.",
    "I guess we did.",
    "Hardly would be sorry.",
    "Neither will l.",
    "I'll see ya.",
    "I'll do your hair.",

    "I thought Baby told you. Look, I'm not sure.",
    "Penny said so, but you know with girls like that. They're liable to pin it...",
    "on any guy around.",
    "- What's the hot tip for the day? - Finished.",
    "You and me, Tito. We've seen it all, eh?",
    "Bubbah and Zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders.",
    "Through the war years when we didn't have any meat.",
