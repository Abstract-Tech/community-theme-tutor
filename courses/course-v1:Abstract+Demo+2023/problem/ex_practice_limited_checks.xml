    <p>Often, you will have a limited number of times that you can check your answer. Here you can practice with 100 attempts.</p>
    <p>When there are a limited number of checks available on a question, a blue "Save" button will appear, as well as counters on the number of used and available submissions. If you would like to input an answer and keep it in the system until you come back to the same question, use the "save" button. This will not submit your answer or use up any of your submissions for the question. Instead, saving an answer will simply keep the answer that you saved and present it back to you when you look at the question again. Please note: in order to get a grade on your answer, you must click "Check" to submit your answer to the grader. As always, only your last checked answer counts for your grade.</p>
    <p>Try entering an answer and saving it without checking. Now press check to see what your answer was. You can also experiment by giving a wrong answer on purpose to see how the system behaves.</p>
