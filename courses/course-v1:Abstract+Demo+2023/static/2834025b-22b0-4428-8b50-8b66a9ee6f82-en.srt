00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,920
ERIC: Hi, and welcome to the edX demonstration course.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,450
I'm Eric, and I'm here to help you get a better understanding of how fun and

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,080
easy it is to take an edX course.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,700
So, let's get started.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,950
Let me show you how all the parts work together.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,000
If at any time you want to skip this video and get a firsthand experience

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,020
of the demonstration course, all you have to do is click

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,710
week one to the left.

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,050
Don't worry, I won't be offended.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,730
Let's first look along the top of the page.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,990
This area's called the navigation bar.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,950
Click on Courseware to interact with your course.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,190
Course Info contains course announcements and updates from the

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,390
course staff.

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,130
If your course has digital textbooks, this is where you'll find them.

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,720
Discussion is where you can communicate with the fellow students

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,380
on topics and projects, and even occasionally with the course staff.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,430
When available, the course Wiki acts as a knowledge base for your course.

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a helpful resource.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,980
Clicking on Progress will reveal how well you're doing in

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,790
your studies and exams.

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,000
When you take the demo course, we'll provide you with a simple progress

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,590
report matching your results.

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,440
Let's look at the left column now.

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,710
The left side of the Courseware screen contains a course navigation bar

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,790
starting from the top down.

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,110
Many courses start with an overview of edX and an introduction to the course.

28
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,570
Below the overview are segments of the course, which are released as the

29
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,080
course progresses.

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,950
Typically, an edX course is delivered in week by week segments, and have

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,580
lessons and homeworks you need to complete.

32
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,270
Many courses are 10 to 12 weeks long.

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,920
We made this demonstration course three weeks for simplicity.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,070
Let's now look at the learning sequence.

35
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,920
Each item in the left column reveals a corresponding learning sequence.

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,600
Work your way from left to right.

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Learning sequences can contain lectures, exercises, and interactive

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,090
lessons that you can complete on your own schedule.

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,760
Next, let's discover what makes edX fun and unique, its interactivity.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,410
edX prides itself on its interactive lessons, which can include

41
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,600
demonstrations, visualizations, and virtual environments.

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,190
You can try out some in the demo course.

43
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,590
Interactive lessons are often graded and contribute to your final grade.

44
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,480
While the edX platform also supports more traditional question formats like

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,985
multiple choice, our classes also test your understanding by allowing you to

46
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:23,930
use labs and simulators, and even asking you to write an essay.

47
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,400
Example of these graded interactions are in the demo course.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,640
You can see how the questions the course uses for gauging your learning

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,620
process can even be auto graded, or detailed feedback given in real time.

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,350
So while an edX course might be rigorous, the tools and visualizations

51
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,280
are really fun and truly interactive.

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,560
Finally, there are many ways successful students like to you

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,740
interact to get the most out of a course.

54
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,560
Beyond the discussion forums, you can meet and engage with fellow classmates

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,050
through a local meet up-- which we highly recommend--

56
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,830
a Google Hangout, or even invite students to join you via Twitter,

57
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,820
Facebook, or other social networks.

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,970
It's a proven fact that if you engage with others while taking a course,

59
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,990
you're more likely to succeed.

60
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,110
Now that you've seen how easy it is to take an edX course, experience this

61
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,070
demonstration course.

62
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,980
Firsthand all you have to do is click on week one to the left and you can

63
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,230
get started.

64
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,710
