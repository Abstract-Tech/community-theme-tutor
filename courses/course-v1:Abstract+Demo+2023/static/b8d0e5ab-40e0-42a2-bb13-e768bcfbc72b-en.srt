Hi. My name is Ryan. Today, I'm going to introduce you to the model organism,

1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,910
Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,019
or more commonly known as the budding yeast. In this video

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,809
I'm going to demonstrate for you how geneticists grow and replicate

4
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,760
yeast, just like Professor Lander described in experiments to identify

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,100
arginine auxotrophs. In this flask, I have liquid media containing the sugar,

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,900
glucose

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,090
nitrogen and phosphorus sources; all 20 amino acids; and some salt.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,150
This is what's called complete or rich media. In some experiments,

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,600
we may choose not to include one or more amino acids.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,219
Earlier today, I added agar to this liquid medium

11
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,790
and then heated the mixture to sterilize it and help everything dissolve.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,200
The medium is liquid while hot. But once it cools down, the agar will cause the

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,399
medium to solidify.

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,770
Once the media is cool to touch, I can pour the liquid mixture into a sterile

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,550
Petri dish.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,020
We'll come back in about 30 minutes once the media has solidified.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,930
Now that I got some agar plates prepared, I can show you how to start

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,739
growing yeast.

19
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,030
We store strains of yeast in a freezer in these small vials.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,260
I will use a sterile loop to collect some yeast from the vial

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,610
and place them onto the rich media. To streak the cells, I'll use a new loop to

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,670
spread the cells out.

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,530
Now that the cells are plated and streaked, we need to incubate the dish at 30

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,590
degrees Celsius,

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,180
the ideal temperature for yeast to grow. We should see colonies in about two days.

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,280
Did our yeast cells grow and divide overnight? Let's take a look.

27
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,220
After a night of growth, you can see that we now have individual colonies from the

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,360
culture we streaked out.

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,090
Remember that each colony represents not a single cell

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,170
but a single cell that has grown and divided many times over. We streaked frozen

31
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,170
yeast cells out to get the cells started.

32
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,270
To inoculate the liquid medium with yeast, I'm picking a single colony with a sterile

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,829
loop

34
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,540
and placing it in the test tube. This liquid media contains the same components as

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,000
our

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,649
Petri dish media except for the agar. Notice that the liquid is clear.

37
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,829
I'll shake this test tube in a 30-degree incubator

38
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,399
overnight. So let's take a look at that culture we inoculated yesterday.

39
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,689
If we compare the inoculated culture to fresh medium,

40
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,390
we can clearly see that the inoculated culture is turbid because our yeast grew and

41
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,520
divided many times.
