    "SPEAKER 1: OK, let's dive right in and try to build this", 
    "abstract memory cell that I just showed you earlier.", 
    "OK, so here's my memory cell.", 
    "It has an input dIN, output dOUT.", 
    "And it has a store signal, OK?", 
    "And recall the property.", 
    "Its property is that when the store signal is high, the", 
    "output put dOUT follows the input.", 
    "And when store goes away, the memory elements simply stores", 
    "the last value that it read when store was high.", 
    "OK, so let's start trying to design this memory cell.", 
    "OK, so let me start with my first attempt.", 
    "OK, so to do so, what I'm going to do is I am going to", 
    "say, look, I need a capacitor.", 
    "I need a capacitor, C, and I'm going to store a value on the", 
    "capacitor node here.", 
    "And that value that it stores is going to be the value that", 
    "I'm going to read out.", 
    "So this is going to be the value that I'm going", 
    "to read out, dOUT.", 
    "And this is going to be my storage node, OK.", 
    "So if I can somehow store a value of this capacitor, then", 
    "that will hold the value for some time, and I will read", 
    "that out at this node, dOUT.", 
    "Now, I need to record an input.", 
    "So let's say for example, I have an input dIN.", 
    "That input is coming in like this.", 
    "When store is high, that input needs to be recorded onto the", 
    "storage node.", 
    "So think switch so I can do the following.", 
    "I can think of a switch, and my switch is connected to--", 
    "the control input of the switch is connected to the", 
    "store signal.", 
    "So let's see if this works.", 
    "So conceptually, this seems to be OK.", 
    "Notice that when store is low, the switch is open.", 
    "And the capacitor will store whatever value it has on it", 
    "and will make it available at dOUT.", 
    "When store is high, then switch is closed.", 
    "And when the switch is closed when store is high, then dIN", 
    "will be recorded.", 
    "So dIN from here will be recorded onto the capacitor,", 
    "and dOUT will follow suit.", 
    "So this seems to be OK.", 
    "So let's take a closer look at this and do some calculations", 
    "as to how long the store pulse needs to be in, how long the", 
    "capacitor C will hold its value as it is being read.", 
    "Then let's see if it really, really works or not.", 
    "OK, so the first thing that we're going to do is find out", 
    "how long the store pulse has to be in order to write a", 
    "value on the capacitor.", 
    "So here is the equivalent circuit.", 
    "Here's my dOUT.", 
    "Here's the storage node with voltage VC.", 
    "And here's my dIN, and here's my switch.", 
    "Now, if this is a perfectly ideal switch, and this is a", 
    "true short circuit, and if dIN comes from an ideal voltage", 
    "source, then of course I'm going to see my capacitor", 
    "charging instantaneously.", 
    "And so my store pulse can be very, very narrow.", 
    "However, in practice, that is never the case.", 
    "And I'm going to assume that my switch has some finite on", 
    "resistance called ROn.", 
    "OK, so my switch here has some resistance, ROn.", 
    "And so the capacitor C has to charge through", 
    "this resistance ROn.", 
    "So back to my wave forms here, so let's say my", 
    "dIN goes to a 1.", 
    "And here is my store pulse that stays on for", 
    "some period of time.", 
    "Let's say my dOUT is 0 to begin.", 
    "And what's going to happen here?", 
    "So at this point in time, as soon as the store pulse goes", 
    "high, the switch goes into its On state.", 
    "And as soon as the switch goes into its On state, now the", 
    "capacitor C begin surcharge through the resistor ROn.", 
    "With the time constant, T given by ROn C.", 
    "The capacitor begins to charge now.", 
    "As the capacitor begins to charge, the voltage at dOUT", 
    "starts to rise.", 
    "That's the voltage VC.", 
    "So this is the voltage of VC, which turns out to", 
    "be the same as dOUT.", 
    "So that starts to rise, and when the store pulse goes", 
    "away, that value will be held out there.", 
    "So in order to figure out the width of the store pulse, what", 
    "do I have to do?", 
    "What is the equation that governs the dynamics of the", 
    "node with voltage VC?", 
    "Recall I start off with a zero value here, and I'm going to", 
    "go up to a high value.", 
    "So it's an increasing form.", 
    "And so remember, this is governed by e to the", 
    "minus d over RC.", 
    "In this case, it's ROn C.", 
    "And let's assume that dIN is a high voltage VS, for example,", 
    "five volts.", 
    "So if dIN is a high voltage, and the capacitor starts off", 
    "at 0, then the dynamics are given by VS times 1 minute e", 
    "to the S minus over ROn C.", 
    "This is assuming that VC of 0 was 0, OK?", 
    "Recall this was the zero state response of", 
    "my capacitor circuit.", 
    "This is the simple example of VS here, ROn, the capacitor C,", 
    "and this is a VC as my ground node.", 
    "And VC of 0 was 0.", 
    "So in this scenario, the capacitor voltage is governed", 
    "by the ZSR with the capacitor being at zero state, being at", 
    "rest initially.", 
    "OK, so this wave form here is governed by this equation", 
    "shown on the right hand side.", 
    "So what is the minimum width of the store pulse?", 
    "How wide should the store pulse be?", 
    "Well clearly, if the store pulse is too narrow--", 
    "so if the store pulse is too narrow, then my", 
    "dOUT is going to start.", 
    "And before it reaches the total value, the final value,", 
    "it's going to cut off.", 
    "And so VC is not going to charge up all the way to its", 
    "high value.", 
    "So I need to make my store pulse wide enough so that", 
    "actually happens.", 
    "And I can see that-- so this is VC.", 
    "So the best way to do that is to say, I'm starting off at 0,", 
    "0 volts, but I need to get up to at least a V0H, V0hH being", 
    "a valid high voltage.", 
    "So I need to get to V0H, and so this is VS 1", 
    "minus e raised to minus--", 
    "and in this case, I can call this the minimum width of the", 
    "store pulse Tmin divided by ROn C. So the V0H is the high", 
    "value that the capacitor needs to get to.", 
    "And so I replace VC by V0H.", 
    "The capacitor, I'm assuming, starts off at 0.", 
    "In general, that may not be the case.", 
    "And in fact, we give you a little exercise after this", 
    "video snippet to actually compute it if the capacitor", 
    "does not start at 0.", 
    "And then, it's going to rise up to some value.", 
    "And in this case, if my pulse width is--", 
    "for some given pulse width Tmin, the final value is going", 
    "to be governed by VS times 1 minus Tmin e raised to ROn C.", 
    "And that must be equal to V0H to get a circuit that behaves", 
    "in a valid manner.", 
    "So from that, you can compute what this minimum", 
    "pulse width must be.", 
    "Usually, the larger of the value of V0H, the", 
    "Tmin must be larger.", 
    "The pulse width must be larger.", 
    "Similarly, if the switch resistance ROn is very high,", 
    "then Tmin must be higher as well.", 
    "So in general, what we end up doing is making the pulse", 
    "width much larger than Tmin.", 
    "So let's say this is Tpulse, the pulse width.", 
    "So in general, we make Tpulse much greater than Tmin, where", 
    "Tmin is calculated from this expression here.", 
    "What that expression says is that the pulse width must be", 
    "at least Tmin for the voltage and the capacitor to be V0H.", 
    "But in general, I want to give you enough leeway for the", 
    "capacitor to reach its final value, and so therefore, my", 
    "pulse width is taken to be much larger than Tmin.", 
    "OK, so this gives you one constraint in the design of", 
    "this memory cell, how wide must a store pulse be.", 
    "The next step, let's take a look at how long does this", 
    "capacitor actually store the value recorded on it, and to", 
    "see if our method A really, really works or not."
