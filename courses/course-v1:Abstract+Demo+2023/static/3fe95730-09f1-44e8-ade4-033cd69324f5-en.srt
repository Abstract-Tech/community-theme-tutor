00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,230
GREGORY NAGY: In hour zero, where I try to introduce Homeric poetry to

1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,060
people who may never have been exposed to the Iliad and the Odyssey even in

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:20,290
translation, my idea was to get a sense of the medium, which is not a

3
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,690
readable medium because Homeric poetry, in its historical context, was

4
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,210
meant to be heard, not read.

5
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,760
And there are various ways of describing it-- call it oral poetry or

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,580
call it a very specialized kind of oral poetry.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,560
But the important thing is that we, as modern readers, just

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,720
don&#39;t get the medium.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,700
And so I thought before we get into hours 1 through 24, it would be

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:58,030
important to do some kind of big, grand cover everything introduction.

11
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,500
But at the same time, in this introduction, I wanted to get people

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,230
already interested in my technique of using close readings of very specific

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,120
parts of the text in order to get an idea of the overall

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,190
meaning of the text.

15
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:22,490
And so I chose eight such texts, and they&#39;re all very famous, well, some

16
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,470
more famous than others.

17
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,240
And as with the 24 hours, I number these sample texts by

18
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,380
letters of the alphabet.

19
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,250
So its texts A through H.

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,520
What I&#39;d like to do is just go over those passages or text and go through

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,730
them; try to do close readings; try to exemplify the principle of having to

22
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:53,520
read out of the text, not into the text; and also try to say why I picked

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,160
the passages that I picked.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:02,630
And in this case my dialogic partners were Jeff Emanuel and Claudia Filos

25
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,980
who are former students.

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,420
They took former versions of the project that we&#39;re engaged with here.

27
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,680
And as very perceptive fellow learners, they really got the hang of

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,310
how to ask very incisive questions that go to the core of what this whole

29
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,990
project is all about like what&#39;s at stake in the Iliad?

30
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,340
What&#39;s at stake for the number one hero?

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,170
But what&#39;s at stake for some very secondary, bit player hero, as well?

32
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:41,230
How does Achilles see himself as the prototype for the ultimate heroic

33
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,030
experiment--

34
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,420
which is the way I look at the Iliad--

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,610
and how is he self-conscious about it?

36
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,790
CLAUDIA FILOS: So, Greg, can you talk a bit about why you chose these

37
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,970
particular eight passages as the focus passages four hour zero?

38
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,450
GREGORY NAGY: Well, here I was trying to introduce all of Homeric poetry to

39
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,420
people who may not ever have read the Iliad and the Odyssey.

40
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,200
So I thought how can I talk about the Iliad and the Odyssey and show some

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,320
very representative pieces of text?

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,100
And sometimes, I call them passages.

43
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,430
Sometimes, I call them texts.

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,600
When I number them, I call them text.

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:27,050
And all eight of these that I have selected are what in popular culture

46
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:33,010
would be parts of the greatest hits, so to speak, of the Iliad and Odyssey.

47
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,170
So, for example, if you look at text A on this introduction to Homeric poetry

48
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,986
which I call appropriately hour zero, there it is--

49
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:48,010
the first few verses of the Iliad.

50
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,300
In fact, the first 10 verses.

51
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:58,170
So Iliad scroll one, verses 1 through 10.

52
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,000
SPEAKER: Anger, goddess, sing it of Achilles, son of Peleus.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,590
Disastrous anger that made countless pains for the Achaeans and many

54
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,600
steadfast lives it drove down to Hades, heroes&#39; lives.

55
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,050
But their bodies, it made prizes for the dogs and for all birds.

56
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,339
And the will of Zeus was reaching its fulfillment.

57
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,540
Sing starting from the point where the two, I see it now, first had a falling

58
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,440
out, engaging in strife.

59
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,270
I mean--

60
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,170
Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, lord of men, and radiant Achilles.

61
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,540
So, which one of the gods was it who impelled the two to fight with each

62
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,020
other in strife?

63
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,850
It was Apollo, the son of Leda and of Zeus.

64
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,230
For he, infuriated at the king, Agamemnon, caused an evil disease to

65
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:57,110
rise throughout the mass of warriors, and the people were getting destroyed.

66
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,050
GREGORY NAGY: I tried to replicate in my translation the fact that the very

67
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,100
first word of the Iliad is menis, which means anger, a special kind of

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,620
anger, a cosmic anger.

69
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,044
We&#39;ll talk more about that.

70
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,770
That man, tell me, oh muse, the song of that man.

71
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,570
That versatile man who, in very many ways, veered from his path and

72
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,780
wandered off far and wide after he had destroyed the sacred citadel of Troy.

73
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,120
Many different cities of many different people did he see, getting

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,140
to know different ways of thinking.

75
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,740
Many were the pains he suffered in his heart while crossing the sea,

76
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,630
struggling to merit the saving of his own life and his own homecoming, as

77
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,800
well as the homecoming of his comrades.

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,900
But do it he might, he could not save his comrades even though he

79
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,100
very much wanted to.

80
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,850
For they perished through their own deeds of sheer recklessness,

81
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,500
disconnected as they were because of what they did to the cattle of the sun

82
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,480
god Helios--

83
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
they ate them.

84
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,000
So the god deprived them of their day of homecoming.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,570
Starting from any single point of departure, oh goddess, daughter of

86
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,560
Zeus, tell me as you&#39;ve told those who came before me.

87
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,700
GREGORY NAGY: And then if we go to text B, look at that.

88
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,150
The first quote unquote word is man.

89
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,000
All right, in English, we have to say the man, but in the original Greek,

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,210
andra, the man.

91
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,090
And that&#39;s the subject of that epic.

92
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,830
Just as the subject of the Iliad is the anger of Achilles, the subject the

93
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,770
Odyssey is the man who is Odyssey.

94
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,170
So there you are.

95
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:58,090
That&#39;s why I shall zone text B to be the first few verses of the Odyssey.

96
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,520
And in fact just as with the Iliad, it&#39;s the first 10 verses.

97
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,810
Nice and symmetrical.

98
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,700
CLAUDIA FILOS: so those first words are so key.

99
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,450
The epics are telling us right away.

100
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,010
GREGORY NAGY: These epics are-- both of them, Iliad and the Odyssey--

101
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,710
telling what the subject is with the first word.

102
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,060
In the case of the Iliad, first word of 15,000 plus verses.

103
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,580
In the case of the Odyssey, the first word of 12,000 plus verses.

104
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,830
Pretty good.

105
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,100
SPEAKER: And now, tell me, oh muses, who live in your Olympian abodes,

106
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,020
since you are goddesses, and you were there, and you know everything.

107
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,740
But we only hear the kleos and we hear nothing.

108
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,920
Who are the princes of the Danaans?

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,940
GREGORY NAGY: Now look at text C for hour zero.

110
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:54,470
This is where Hector says there&#39;ll be a memory of the time that my fire

111
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,840
nearly destroyed not just the Achaeans but the entirety of Greek

112
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,620
civilization.

113
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,390
You see, if the fire of Hector had reached the ships of the Achaeans that

114
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,650
were beached like sitting ducks on the Hellespont, then, essentially, there

115
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,610
would be no more Greeks.

116
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,220
And so Hector, this character, is very aware of it-- says let there be a

117
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,710
memory of the time when this was about to happen.

118
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:29,640
And so poetic how the fire will confound the key Achaeans who the

119
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,900
Argives, who are the Danaans, by the smoke.

120
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,400
CLAUDIA FILOS: choosing it, you&#39;re saying there&#39;s something very

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,909
important about memory for both.

122
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,760
GREGORY NAGY: It&#39;s all important because this isn&#39;t just memory, this

123
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,350
is poetic memory.

124
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:48,680
And as we&#39;ll see when we get to hour two, it&#39;s a kind of total recall, if I

125
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,620
may use science fiction term.

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,010
SPEAKER: Ah, me, the pitiful one.

127
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,140
Ah, me, the mother, so sad it is of the very best.

128
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,830
I gave birth to a faultless and strong son, the very best of heroes, and he

129
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,080
shot up equal to a seedling.

130
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,350
I nurtured him like a shoot in the choicest spot of the orchard only to

131
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,120
send him off on curved ships to Troy to fight Trojan men.

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,960
And I will never be welcoming him back home as a returning warrior, back to

133
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,050
the house of Peleus.

134
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:34,530
GREGORY NAGY: Let&#39;s go to text D of hour zero, which is where Thetas, the

135
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,970
mother of Achilles, is speaking.

136
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,050
And she&#39;s not just speaking, in terms of the medium, she&#39;s actually singing

137
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,220
a song of lament, and we&#39;ll talk a lot more about lament later.

138
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,710
But I love the fact that as she is lamenting Achilles, who&#39;s not even

139
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:58,450
dead yet, she is comparing him to a tender, young shoot or seedling.

140
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:05,290
And I&#39;m pretty deliberate on why I use not just the translation seedling but

141
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:14,110
also shoot for imagining the hero as a beautiful, young planet.

142
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,560
OK, so there it is.

143
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,890
And even the specifics of the language that she uses, Thetas uses, in her

144
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,910
song of lament for Achilles, who&#39;s not even dead yet--

145
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,140
some of the specific language like [INAUDIBLE]

146
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,860
which I translated as he shot up.

147
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,510
It&#39;s a kind of violent, vegetal activity that you would associate with

148
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,220
mutant phenomena, not necessarily natural phenomena.

149
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,120
Sure, a growing planet is natural but this is an unnatural growth.

150
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,680
It&#39;s just so much quicker and so much more vibrant.

151
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,660
CLAUDIA FILOS: going to be thinking about what&#39;s

152
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,940
natural and what&#39;s unnatural?

153
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,110
GREGORY NAGY: Very much so.

154
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,020
I try never to use the word supernatural.

155
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,100
I&#39;ll try to use a superhuman because even the superhuman realm can still be

156
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,210
a function of nature.

157
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,260
JEFF EMANUEL: This an example maybe of what we&#39;re going to be thinking in

158
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,470
extremes as well.

159
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,420
GREGORY NAGY: Very much extremes.

160
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,340
And as we&#39;ll see it in our working definition of the

161
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,700
hero, the hero is extreme.

162
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,530
That&#39;s definitely one of the major characteristics.

163
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:23,840
When we talk about the growth spurt of Achilles, I&#39;m tempted to say that it&#39;s

164
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,780
an unnatural growth spurt.

165
