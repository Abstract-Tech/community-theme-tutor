0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
SPEAKER 1: What we see here-- a mess.

1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,970
OK?

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,120
What we have is a voltmeter and an amp meter.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,200
The amp meter measures current, the voltmeter

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,680
measures voltage of course.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,585
And we're measuring the voltage across the light

6
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,190
bulb-- the lamp.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,092
And we're measuring the current into the lamp.

8
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:22,430
PETER: So we've got a voltmeter

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,240
measuring across the--

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,720
volts meter--

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,090
across there.

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,565
And then we've got an amp reader measuring into.

13
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:35,120
SPEAKER 1: Right.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,286
Exactly.

15
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:41,120
Now, we're going to connect that to a battery.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,065
The three cell battery that you've seen before.

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,680
And we're going to see, of course, that the

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,980
light bulb lit up.

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,180
And the current we measure is 122 milliamperes going into

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,430
the light bulb.

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,900
122 milliamperes.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:11,960
And the voltage across is from the plus to minus, 4.31 volts.

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,680
OK?

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,160
Now, we can do another experiment.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,350
Notice how the light bulb is lit up and how much it's lit,

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,150
approximately.

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,740
Now, I'm going to reverse the battery so that we connect the

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,370
battery in the opposite polarity.

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,550
OK.

30
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,881
Go ahead, Peter.

31
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:37,890
PETER: You connect it, I will draw.

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,640
SPEAKER 1: OK, I'm just doing it.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,250
PETER: So I'll swap these.

34
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,060
SPEAKER 1: Yes, sir.

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,310
OK.

36
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:51,080
And what we observe is basically the amp meter is

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,360
measuring 122 milliamperes in the negative direction.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,050
So that means it's measuring the current

39
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,420
into the light bulb--

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,370
because I've not changed the orientation with respect to

41
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,440
the light bulb--

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,540
of minus 122 milliamperes.

43
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,080
And the voltage across the light bulb, from here to here,

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,240
is minus 4.29 volts.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,330
PETER: Sorry, that's a minus?

46
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:17,550
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

47
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,640
PETER: So if we look at the power in the first case, 122

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:35,450
milliamps times 4.31 volts, we get 526 milliwatts.

49
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,320
SPEAKER 1: Yep.

50
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,040
PETER: If we measure the power in this case over here, minus

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:50,610
122 milliamps times minus 4.29 volts, we get approximately

52
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,350
the same thing.

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,810
So I'm going to round it off to, let's say best guess, 524,

54
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,570
maybe 23 or something.

55
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,550
No less.

56
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,960
SPEAKER 1: OK.

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,590
PETER: So this is equal to that within measurement error.

58
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,780
SPEAKER 1: And of course, you see the power is the power

59
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,290
going into the light bulb and coming out as light and heat.

60
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,180
OK?

61
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,220
We have arranged our measurements by having these

62
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,480
associated reference directions, so that this is

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,850
plus and that's minus, and that the current always goes

64
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,910
into the terminal that we label with plus.

65
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,270
That always means that the power we measure by

66
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,690
multiplying these two numbers is the power

67
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,440
going into this device.

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,360
PETER: So this light bulb is dissipating 524 milliwatts.

69
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,920
If we were to do the same calculation for the battery,

70
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,360
so current would be going to the positive

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,040
terminal, we would--

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,952
SPEAKER 1: Well, you have to measure it then

73
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:53,188
from there to there.

74
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:53,980
PETER: Yeah.

75
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,650
Plus, minus.

76
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,790
That's what we're doing.

77
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,560
So this would be 4.29 volts.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,150
The current would still be minus 122 milliamps.

79
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,040
The current's moving in a loop, so here is the same as

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,775
here, but the signs are swapped.

81
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:17,040
That same calculation would give us minus 524 milliwatts.

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,280
And that's because the battery is outputting power, whereas

83
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,195
the light bulb is dissipating power.

84
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,740
SPEAKER 1: Think about it as, if we're measuring the power

85
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,967
entering the battery, it's minus 524 milliwatts.

86
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,250
OK?

87
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,055
That's the way to think about it.

88
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:33,910
This always gives you the power entering that element.
