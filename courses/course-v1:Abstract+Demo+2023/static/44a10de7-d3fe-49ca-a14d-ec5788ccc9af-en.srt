JOSE ANDRES: Hello, people of Harvard, people of the world.

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,680
My name is Jose Andres.

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,920
I am a chef.

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,970
You, I, we are at minibar.

6
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:46,714
minibar is very much the heart of everything I do.

7
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:52,010


8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,090
I've been cooking since I was 14.

9
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,870
I began working in kitchens in Barcelona, and especially in one of a

10
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,990
restaurant called El Bulli, a restaurant that nobody knew back in

11
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:15,050
the '80s, and where the chef was a young guy called Ferran Adria.

12
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,450
Almost 30 years later, I'm very proud to tell you that he's

13
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,365
one of my best friends.

14
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:23,795
He's my mentor.

15
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:29,720
And he's the person I learned the most from, and is, without a doubt, the

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,480
reason that we were able to put together this amazing

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,010
physics class at Harvard.

18
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,170
So, just for the record, I am a chef.

19
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,120
We are chefs.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,460
We cook.

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,390
We are not trying to be physicists.

22
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,910
We are not trying to be scientists.

23
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:01,660
We are only trying to make sure that the culinary world and the science

24
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,619
world talk to each other.

25
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:11,090


26
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,860
Everything you're going to be learning is the very clear explanation of

27
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,030
everything that happens in cooking every day in every kitchen and through

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,972
hundreds of years of history.

29
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:32,310


30
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,280
minibar every night, more than 30 courses.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,470
And, quite frankly, probably many of the techniques we use here, you've

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,110
been learning them through the class.

33
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,050
And if not, you will.

34
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:50,110
But one of the classes I give every year is about gelation.

35
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,456
And probably the star of gelation will be a spherification.

36
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:58,070
And here, we are doing a lot of spheres.

37
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,580


38
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,660
But this one is cooler.

39
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,880
Come here.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,170
When you're able to do a spherification using a beautiful clam

41
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,440
and kind of making sure that the natural juice of the clam will remain

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,980
outside the meat of the clam, this is brilliant.

43
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,080
And this is why I'm so happy about this class at Harvard, that for the

44
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:34,240
first time, we've really been able to take seriously the amazing connection

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,160
between science and the food we eat.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,120
Before, we were in the dark.

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,760
Today, I see light on the horizon.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,250
Today, we are far away more prepared.

49
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,010
So, see you soon.

50
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,040
Hasta pronto.

51
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,060
Bye bye.

52
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,780
I'm very funny, because for the few people that sometimes have something

53
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,900
against molecular cooking, well, take a look at this.

54
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,600
We are grating Parmesan cheese.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,450
Wow.

56
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,650
This is really molecular.
